## Table 2 Replication Approach

We modified the original Table 2 presentation by separating Wave 2 and Wave 3 results into Tables 2a and 2b for clearer interpretation. The original paper presented all four models in a single table, making it harder to distinguish between short-term and longer-term effects.

We also added unweighted difference-in-differences (DiD) models alongside the original weighted specifications. This addition serves as a robustness check to determine whether the results depend on the inverse probability weighting (IPW) scheme. Weighted models can be sensitive to how weights are constructed, especially in panel data where dropout patterns might differ between treatment and control groups.

Notably, our weighted and unweighted Wave 2 DiD models show virtually identical results (Treat x Post coefficient: Weighted = -0.301, Unweighted = -0.298, with nearly identical standard errors: Weighted SE = 0.116, Unweighted SE = 0.115). This similarity suggests that attrition in the study was essentially random with respect to treatment status and outcomes, meaning the weighting procedure had negligible impact. This strengthens confidence in the robustness of the findings, as they're consistent regardless of whether weights are applied. Both estimates now closely match the original paper's coefficient (-0.301).

This similarity raises the question of whether the original authors' use of inverse probability weighting added unnecessary methodological complexity, given its minimal effect on results. Our robustness check strengthens confidence in the paper's conclusions about program effects on migration aspirations, as the treatment effects aren't merely artifacts of the weighting method.
