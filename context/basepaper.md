**Abstract**

Parallel to traditional immigration control policies, states send substantial
amounts of foreign aid to address the root causes of migration. Using a ran-
domized controlled trial (RCT), we evaluate a representative type of "root
causes" aid (RCA) project in Africa, implemented by the UN's International
Organization for Migration (IOM). We find the project reduced aspirations to
migrate and slowed preparations for the journey. Multiple mediation analysis
shows "instrumental place attachment" or the ability to pursue impor-
tant goals in one's place of residence compared to other destinations-is
the main driver. However, effects wane 6 months after project end. That a
small RCA project increased instrumental place attachment, albeit briefly, is
significant given global inequalities. We explore this finding by conducting
interviews with international organization (IO) and nongovernmental orga-
nization (NGO) practitioners to understand how development organizations
affect instrumental place attachment, and with youth to understand how
interventions (un) successfully moderate the choice to stay or migrate.

States use a variety of policies to limit immigration.
Traditional means of control tend to be compul-
sory. They include restricting visa entries, building
walls and fences, and deporting migrants who attempt
to enter or settle without documentation. Parallel
to these compulsory means of control, states pur-
sue migration control through economic incentives.
Specifically, states send significant amounts of for-
eign aid, often through international organizations, to
areas with high migration propensity. This is referred
to as "Root Causes Aid" (RCA). The intention of this aid
is to make the option to stay more attractive through
economic development, thereby stopping migration
before it begins (Christensen & Simon, 2023; Clemens
& Postel, 2018).¹

Using aid to control migration has become more
popular since the European and Central American
refugee emergencies in the mid-2010s. In 2015, the
European Union set up a financial instrument-the
EU Trust Fund for Africa (EUTF)-which allocated
€4.5 billion in aid to projects aimed explicitly at lim-
iting migration from the continent (Raty and Shilhav,
2020). The Obama administration set up a similar
fund, which was revamped by the Biden administra-
tion. The Biden-Harris Root Causes Strategy is said
to be a critical element in the United States' efforts
to limit migration from Northern Triangle (Hesson &
Spetalnick, 2021; White House, 2021).

However, despite its popularity, we still do not
know whether foreign aid is an effective immigration
control policy. Specifically, we do not know whether
it reduces migration (e.g., Lanati & Thiele, 2018)
or whether it, in fact, increases it (e.g., Berthélemy
et al., 2009). Classical theory on the "migration hump"
expects migration from low-income countries to rise
with foreign aid. If aid makes individuals financially

better off-but home countries continue to lack
proper infrastructure and public services, political
instability remains high and economic policies ham-
per growth-potential migrants may simply use this
aid to offset the costs and risks of migration (Haas,
2007, p. 836).

To illustrate, consider a young potential migrant liv-
ing in a country with poor prospects for economic
growth. This person is selected to participate in an
RCA project. Given low expectations that the politi-
cal or economic situation in her home country will
improve, she may find it difficult to put this aid to
work there, and may be better off repurposing these
gains into a migration rather than a livelihood project
at home. In other words, because aid of any kind can-
not credibly change her home country's political or
economic situation within her working life, participat-
ing in this project may improve her exit options more
than her options to stay. As a result, she may choose
migration.

However, we argue that effective aid may also trigger
a less equivocal psychological mechanism: instrumen-
tal place attachment (Ghosn et al., 2021; McKenzie,
2022; Scannell & Gifford, 2010; Simon et al., 2022).
People in high-emigration countries may display low
attachment to their country of birth for a range of
social and instrumental reasons (Conrad Suso, 2019;
Hernández-Carretero & Carling, 2012).

From an instrumental perspective, we are likely to
feel more attached to places that offer the things that
we need to pursue important goals, and do so bet-
ter than any other place (e.g., Scannell & Gifford,
2010, p. 6). We argue that development actors channel-
ing foreign aid-international organizations and non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) can positively
reinforce instrumental place attachment by increasing
people's access and understanding of how to use local
assets (i.e., physical, natural, or financial resources).
This, in turn, may be associated with the belief that
specific livelihood goals can be better achieved locally
than anywhere else. In other words, even if conditions
abroad are generally better, development interven-
tions may prompt the belief that "here, I know what
I need and how to get it."

We test our argument through a randomized con-
trolled trial (RCT) evaluating a UK government Youth
Employment Program (YEP), implemented by the
UN's International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The UK-IOM project was carried out in The Gambia-
a country with high rates of emigration-and its stated
aim was to soften migratory aspirations. According
to the IOM, Gambians have emigrated at a higher
rate per capita than every other country in Africa in
recent years (IOM, 2021), and most of these migrants
are young adults (Armitano, 2017).² YEPs are repre-
sentative of RCA sent for economic development in

sub-Saharan Africa (Conrad Suso, 2019). For example,
the economic development arm of the EUTF describes
its mission statement, almost exclusively, as estab-
lishing "economic development programs addressing
youths and vulnerable groups' employability" (EUTF,
2022). Youth unemployment in sub-Saharan Africa
ranges from 18% to 50% (Adepoju, 2019), and it drives
migration (Simon et al., 2022); approximately 95% of
irregular migrants from The Gambia cite "lack of work"
as their main reason for migrating (Gambia Bureau of
Statistics, 2018).

The 3-month project began in February 2021,
roughly 10 months into the Covid-19 pandemic. At
the time, mobility restrictions inhibited actual migra-
tion from the region. However, economic insecurities
fuelled a greater aspiration to emigrate (Mixed Migra-
tion Centre, 2021). At the time the project began,
sub-Saharan Africa had seen a loss in working hours
equivalent to approximately 22 million full-time jobs
(ILO, 2021). Moreover, young Gambians did not have
confidence in their government's ability to ensure a
quick economic recovery for the country (Simon et al.,
2022). This context presents a particularly tough test
for this RCA project, but usefully highlights salient
features of our argument; it allows us to observe
whether aid projects can create place-bound anchors,
while economic conditions at an international level
are particularly unequal.

We found that-in addition to the tangible, pos-
itive effects on starting or growing businesses-the
project significantly reduced aspirations to migrate
and slowed preparations for the journey. However,
the program had no long-term effects on aspira-
tion. We saw a reduction in the estimated effects
of the project on aspirations when we followed up
6 months later. Instrumental place attachment is one
of multiple mechanisms that may be triggered by
an intervention of the kind we examined. Like many
poverty-alleviation projects, the program was primar-
ily intended to promote economic self-sufficiency by
allowing participants to start or grow an existing busi-
ness. Evaluations of educational programs-this one
contained a skills training component-also tend to
focus on self-efficacy (Banerjee et al., 2015; Beaman
et al., 2012; Wuepper & Lybbert, 2017). Self-efficacy
is an important development outcome in and of
itself, because it can "empower" recipients to follow
through with domestic goals and tackle political and
institutional barriers.³ As we argue below, neither self-
efficacy nor economic self-sufficiency are enough to
reduce the aspiration to migrate, absent of instrumen-
tal place attachment. However, we expected these two
mechanisms to play a supporting role.

We find that self-sufficiency and self-efficacy, while
significantly improved in the short and long term,
do not channel the effects of the program to
migration aspirations. In contrast, instrumental place
attachment does transmit the effect. Specifically, we

SIMON ET AL..

find that participants in the program were signifi-
cantly more likely to report that it was easier for them
to achieve their livelihood goals in The Gambia than
abroad. This finding is particularly striking given real
and perceived global inequalities in pandemic recov-
ery. However, the program's effect on instrumental
place attachment is the step of the causal chain that
is most short-lived. As such, our analysis reveals the
importance of instrumental place attachment for RCA,
while also suggesting the challenge in maintaining
these effects.

Having established through mediation analysis
that instrumental place attachment is the primary
aspiration-attenuating mechanism, we then examine
how the IOM's RCA project triggered instrumental
place attachment in the first place and why these
effects were so short-lived. We conduct interviews
with practitioners from international organizations
and NGOs involved in the design and implementation
of the program, as well as Gambian entrepreneurs who
did not participate in the IOM project. This qualita-
tive analysis highlighted two key dimensions affecting
attachment to place: the ability to navigate govern-
ment regulations and social capital through local net-
works of mentors and entrepreneurs. The IOM project
intervened on these two dimensions with varying suc-
cess, and descriptive quantitative analyses confirm
that these dimensions significantly predict instru-
mental place attachment. We also find that young
entrepreneurs value this kind of aid and its poten-
tial to help them pursue the specific place-bound goal
they have chosen. However, our analysis also suggests
why this aid fails young entrepreneurs in the long
term, and why migration may enter their minds once
again.

Our paper contributes to the growing literature on
states' use of foreign aid in migration governance
(e.g., Bermeo & Leblang, 2015; Blair & Wright, 2022;
Gamso & Yuldashev, 2018; Lehmann & Masterson,
2020; Whitaker, 2008; Zhou & Shaver, 2021) by exam-
ining the psychological mechanisms connecting aid
to migration aspirations. In doing so, we develop a
general theory of instrumental place attachment that
can be used to better understand how development
organizations and origin country governments shape
individual livelihoods and decision making (UNDP,
2017). Finally, we contribute to literature examining
the effects and effectiveness of immigration policy
(Cornelius & Rosenblum, 2005; Schon & Leblang,
2021) by evaluating states' alternative, "development-
friendly" immigration policies (Gamso & Yuldashev,
2018, p. 809). We find that the RCA program had no
long-term effect on migration aspirations, even if they
were temporarily muted. From a policy perspective,
it is important to contextualize this finding in terms
of actual migration decisions that involve meticulous
planning (UNDP, 2019) and can take years to execute
(van der Velde & van Naerssen, 2015).

INSTRUMENTAL PLACE ATTACHMENT
AND OTHER MECHANISMS OF "ROOT
CAUSES" AID

3

RCA is usually targeted at countries and areas with
a high propensity for emigration; its projects aim to
address segments of the population who are more
likely to emigrate; and RCA programs are often eval-
uated in terms of their migration outcomes (Raty &
Shilhav, 2020). However, in essence, RCA projects
resemble tried-and-tested development assistance
projects or programs. We focus on RCA projects that
help the poor pursue economic livelihood strategies.
For example, these interventions aim to generate
greater educational, recreational, and vocational
opportunities; to support small ad medium-sized
enterprises; or to improve trade. EU and US pro-
grams also fund basic services-shelter, water and
sanitation, education, transport, electrical grids, and
so forth and support agricultural businesses and
climate-change adaptation (Clemens & Postel, 2018;
Raty & Shilhav, 2020). In our theory, we focus solely on
projects delivered by non-state actors (see Dietrich,
2013).

RCA projects that help the poor pursue eco-
nomic livelihood strategies intend to reduce migra-
tion through economic self-sufficiency (real and per-
ceived), but they often hope to strengthen perceived
self-efficacy or "empowerment" as well. These are
classic features of poverty-alleviating interventions
regardless of whether they intend to reduce migra-
tion (Barrett et al., 2016; Beaman et al., 2012; Wuepper
& Lybbert, 2017). We introduce an additional mech-
anism relating specifically to migration outcomes-
instrumental place attachment and will argue that,
while the two classic mechanisms can affect people's
aspirations to migrate, these effects can go in either
direction. Increasing instrumental place attachment
will, more decisively, reduce migration aspirations.

## Economic self-sufficiency

Donor governments are particularly interested in facil-
itating economic self-sufficiency, or economic inde-
pendence (Hetling et al., 2016), among the young
because young adults are the most mobile age group
(Aslany et al., 2021). Lack of employment prospects
in sub-Saharan Africa means young people face a
prolonged and involuntary "period of suspension"
between childhood and adulthood (Vigh, 2006, p. 27),
which can fuel a desire to emigrate. In The Gambia,
this feeling is known as "nerves syndrome" (Con-
rad Suso, 2019). Across studies, unemployment and
underemployment tend to increase aspirations to
migrate, particularly for the young (Aslany et al., 2021).
However, individual economic betterment is nei-
ther necessary nor sufficient to soften them. In fact,

being economically better off may increase aspirations
to migrate because it can increase individuals' ability
to meet the costs of migration (Haas, 2007; Martin &
Taylor, 1996). Literature on sub-Saharan Africa sug-
gests that people with the lowest incomes might
lack the "capacity to aspire" (Appadurai, 2004) but,
once the opportunity to migrate becomes available,
aspirations may follow.

## Perceived self-efficacy

Perceived economic self-sufficiency may also be
accompanied by other psychological mechanisms
that pull toward home, however. International orga-
nizations and NGOs often aim to promote self-
efficacy through education. Increasing individuals'
self-efficacy⁴ can give recipients the resources, confi-
dence, and motivation to follow through with domes-
tic goals (Bandura, 1977), and learn how to tackle
any obstacles they encounter when doing so (Beaman
et al., 2012; Wuepper & Lybbert, 2017). Self-efficacious
individuals will also have greater perceived control
over adverse events related to their domain of com-
petence, and will tend to tackle these threats head-on
(Bandura, 1977). It is possible, then, that recipients
who perceive higher self-efficacy will see political and
economic risks in their home country as ones they are
competent to tackle (Ghosn et al., 2021).⁵

However, a root causes project that promotes self-
efficacy may still be unsuccessful in reducing migra-
tion. Even if a person feels competent enough to deal
with home country risks, she may consider risks in
another country to be lower. For instance, Simon et al.
(2022) find that higher risk aversion is associated with
a higher, not lower, aspiration to migrate among Gam-
bian youth. A stronger psychological threshold may
need to be surpassed, one where the place of residence
not only becomes a more favorable option than it used
to be, but becomes a better option than anywhere else.
This notion is captured by the concept of instrumental
place attachment.

## Instrumental place attachment

Place attachment is a cognitive and emotional bond
between an individual and a place (Scannell &
Gifford, 2010). Individuals will exhibit different
degrees of place attachment as a result of different

⁴ The belief "in one's capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action
required to produce given attainments" (Bandura et al., 1999, p. 3).

⁵ Self-efficacy in one domain (e.g., managing a business) is not expected to
translate into self-efficacy in another (e.g., making a migration journey). By
the same token, Perceived Self Efficacy is only expected to influence risk atti-
tudes within the specific domain in which it operates (see also Nicholson et al.,
2005, on domain-specific risk attitudes).

CAN FOREIGN AID REDUCE THE DESIRE TO EMIGRATE?

experiences within the course of their life. Much of the
relevant literature examines the extreme end of the
spectrum, focusing on how individuals with strong
place attachment will have difficulty emigrating even
if it would be most adaptive for them to do so (e.g., De
Dominicis et al., 2015). This is partly because peo-
ple endow places with culturally shared meaning,
and staying gives them a sense of continuity of self
(Twigger-Ross & Uzzell, 1996). Young people social-
ized as part of a strong "culture of migration" might be
on the other side of the place-attachment spectrum.
Indeed, young men in sub-Saharan Africa often derive
culturally shared meaning from migrating, and migra-
tion is an important part of their identity (Conrad
Suso, 2019; Hernández-Carretero & Carling, 2012).

We do not have clear expectations on how develop-
ment actors might affect the identity-related aspects
of place attachment. However, place attachment is a
multidimensional concept. Aside from identity, secu-
rity and "goal support" are the two most common
dimensions considered in the literature (Scannell &
Gifford, 2010, p. 5).⁶ We group these latter two dimen-
sions into what we call instrumental place attachment.
Instrumental place attachment relates to how well a
place serves our goals, "given an existing range of alter-
natives" (Jorgensen & Stedman, 2001, p. 234). We are
likely to feel more attached to places that offer things
that we need to pursue goals we consider important,
and do so better than any other place. Because liveli-
hood goals are particularly weighty or essential, places
that support these goals also offer security (Shumaker
& Taylor, 1983).

Instrumental place attachment is conditioned on
the knowledge and familiarity to extract and use the
resources needed to pursue these goals within the
place (e.g., Ghosn et al., 2021; Landon et al., 2021). If a
person's goal is to have a successful agricultural busi-
ness, for example-she needs to have access to certain
resources (i.e., good land and the technology and labor
required to cultivate it). If these resources are available,
the person knows how to access them, and, as a result,
she expects her agricultural business to thrive, this
person's attachment to her place of residence should
be positively reinforced.

The poor may face significant disadvantages in
terms of resources and knowledge on how to access
existing resources in the origin country, and service
providers may help bridge this gap. According to the
sustainable livelihoods framework-which guides the
interventions of major aid agencies (UNDP, 2017)-
the pursuit of livelihood goals or strategies is given
by access to five types of productive assets, or "cap-
itals," in one's place of residence: natural resources,

⁶ The identity dimension of place attachment relates to "continuity of self"
over time that is, historical attachments; or between the place and the
person that is, when a place matches people's personal values or seems to
represent them (Twigger-Ross & Uzzell, 1996).

economic or financial capital, human capital, social
capital, and physical assets such as infrastructure.
Access to livelihood assets is, in turn, formally con-
strained by laws, policies, and institutions in the place
where one lives (UNDP, 2017, p. 2). Corrupt or ineffi-
cient governments can make it more or less difficult for
individuals to access credit-for instance, by obscur-
ing or withholding the information needed to do so,
or by explicitly excluding certain individuals; they can
bar access to physical assets by limiting property rights
(e.g., Leblang, 1996); less predictable, discriminatory
or obfuscatory laws can also erode social capital (e.g.,
Kumlin & Rothstein, 2005).

When governments fail to provide access to assets in
this way, development actors may step in and carry out
specific governance roles (e.g., Risse & Stollenwerk,
2018). They may do so by making the resource avail-
able in the place, and by increasing people's knowledge
and familiarity with accessing an existing resource.
Given the theory described above, a development
actor that does these things may increase instrumental
place attachment. Through interviews with develop-
ment practitioners, we will illustrate how development
actors may increase instrumental place attachment by
facilitating access to capitals. In the project we eval-
uate here, the IOM provided a good (education and
financial aid), engaged with local governments directly
to provide identity documents and access to credit,
trained participants to understand and navigate local
bureaucratic obstacles, and created environments that
would strengthen social capital.

All in all, instrumental place attachment may be
more decisive in reducing the aspiration to migrate.
However, intuitively, it is also a difficult needle to move
in a poor country with high migration propensity. This
is because it requires believing that livelihood goals are
more attainable in one's place of residence than they
are anywhere else. It is intuitively difficult for (small)
RCA interventions to change deep-seated conceptions
of where one's country stands in contrast to wealth-
ier nations, where resources may seem easier to access
and livelihood goals easier to accomplish.

However, the extent to which an organization is
able or willing to do this probably differs by con-
text. First, the actors delivering aid are different in
terms of their political incentives and the resources
at their disposal. For example, NGOs' inherent polit-
ical incentive to be accountable to their beneficiaries
(Banks & Hulme, 2012) may make them better placed
to enhance instrumental place attachment than IOs
like the IOM. Specifically, their understanding of local
obstacles and their embeddedness in the community
may make them more efficient at helping beneficiaries
access productive capitals and strengthen instrumen-
tal place attachment. The organization's resources
and influence may also matter. As we discuss in our
interviews below, organizations that are able to influ-

5

ence bureaucrats or policy may be more effective in
promoting instrumental place attachment.

Aid modalities may also play a role. For example,
although our paper focuses on aid delivered by non-
state actors, we might also consider situations where
aid is sent by the donor directly to the recipient gov-
ernment for disbursement. Donors may avoid this
channel, due to concerns that the aid may not reach
its intended beneficiaries (Dietrich, 2013).

Indeed, empirical research often finds a positive
correlation between aid and corruption (Alesina
&
Weder, 2002, but see Menard & Weill, 2016). If, as we
have argued above, corrupt and inefficient govern-
ments hamper instrumental place attachment and aid
increases corruption, aid is likely to have the opposite
effects on instrumental place attachment to the ones
described.

In the absence of corruption, however, aid pro-
vided or disbursed by national rather than foreign
bodies may be qualitatively different. For example, it
may involve changing the laws, policies, and institu-
tions that constrain access to assets-something that
national governments are best placed to do. It is also
important to note that, although, in this paper, we
focus on aid delivered by IOs as a source of instru-
mental place attachment, there are other potential
sources that need to be explored. For example, we do
not know to what extent potential destination coun-
tries may influence instrumental place attachment
through immigration policy, anti-immigrant attitudes,
their economy, or diaspora networks.

# THE INTERVENTION AND DATA
COLLECTION

The intervention under examination seeks to tackle
an important driver of migration from The Gambia-
unemployment. As part of the program, participants
received one-on-one and small group coaching as well
as training in key skills, such as financial literacy and
business management. Participants received a cash
grant (approximately 1600 USD). They received the
funds in two tranches, the first at the start of the pro-
gram to help with start-up costs and the second at the
conclusion of the program.

The empirical strategy for our evaluation was pre-
registered (see Online Appendix R). The program had
an overall capacity of 400 participants, and treatment
and control groups were randomly assigned from an
oversubscribed list of applicants. First, we identified
the 850 highest scoring applicants. Of these 850, the
survey team was able to contact 829 for interviews

after three attempts. We used block randomization to
randomly allocate these 829 respondents to the treat-
ment (participation) or the control group. We blocked
by regional training site to account for variation in
capacity and project implementation across sites.

The IOM-led program-implementing team then
called selected participants to start training. All appli-
cants who the implementing team were unable to
reach after several attempts were removed from the
study. As shown in Online Appendix A, our resulting
survey sample had 380 respondents in the treatment
group and 416 respondents in the control group (48:52
ratio; total: 796). Randomization produced balanced
treatment and control groups. We find no statistically
significant differences between treatment and control
groups in terms of gender, age, education, or score.

**Figure 1** summarizes the timeline of the 10-week
program and the evaluation. We collected data on
program participants and their control group counter-
parts in January 2021 just before the program began,
and then again in May 2021 just a few weeks after
the program ended, and then again 6 months later in
November and December 2021. To maximize reten-
tion and response rates, we offered approximately 5
USD worth of mobile phone credits in waves 2 and 3
(not in wave 1, to encourage voluntary participation
in the study). We determined the incentive amount
and method of delivery in discussion with our local
survey firm. Online Appendix I contains a detailed
description of our ethics protocol.

The timing of data collection around the inter-
vention should ameliorate concerns that respondents
would falsify their answers to satisfy the IOM. All out-
come data were collected 1 month after participants
had already completed their training and received
both tranches of the cash grant. At the point of data
collection, subjects were no longer dependent on the
IOM for any additional funds or support. Addition-
ally, respondents were assured of the independence of
the evaluation, their anonymity, and, more specifically,
that their survey responses would not be shared with
the IOM.⁸

Online Appendix A reports the number of people
who responded to our surveys in each wave. Between
waves 1 and 2, we maintained a recontact rate of
91.5%, but this decreased to 71% between waves 1 and
3. As we show in Online Appendix A, we find no signifi-
cant differences in attrition across treatment and con-
trol groups in wave 2 or 3. However, if individuals left
the study in order to migrate, this could lead to bias.
To account for the possibility, we examine whether
respondents who were more advanced in their migra-
tion plans in the baseline were more likely to leave
the study, and we found no significant effects (Online
Appendix F). In line with our pre-analysis plan, all our
models include inverse-probability weights to com-
pensate for systematic missingness across waves. We
describe the weights and present unweighted results
in Online Appendix I, and all results are substantively
similar.

Taken together, our design has a number of
strengths that allow us to causally identify the effects
of the RCA program. Our treatment and control groups
were drawn from precisely the same subject pool of
highly qualified, young, aspiring entrepreneurs. Data
on these individuals were collected before treatment
allocation, 1 month after the end of the program, and
again 6 months later, and we maintained high levels of
response to each survey wave.

It is important to emphasize that our sample is not
nationally representative. As such, we cannot draw
inferences about the general population. Our study
aims to understand the effects of regional, economic
RCA programs on the populations they target. In
Online Appendix N, we provide sample demographics
and compare our sample to a nationally representative
sample. Our baseline sample has a higher likeli-
hood of employment and a higher level of education
compared to the age-equivalent group in the repre-
sentative sample, and includes 14% fewer women. In
Online Appendix N, we weight our estimates using
a nationally representative sample. Our sample has
characteristics in common with the Gambian popula-
tion most likely to migrate, but it is not representative
of this population (Online Appendix O).

⁸ To avoid inadvertent disclosures, enumerators had no information on
treatment status.
⁹ Some individuals (one in waves 1 and 2, nine in wave 3) were dropped
because of repeated interviews. Where repeat interviews occurred, we ran-
domly selected one to be included in the final data set.

# EFFECTS ON MIGRATION ASPIRATIONS

The program helped many of its participants to open
and expand their own businesses. Table 1 shows the
treatment group was significantly more likely to open
a business, make purchases, hire employees, and earn
a profit by the third wave of data collection.⁹

Having established these outcomes, we examine
whether the program affected migration aspirations
and preparations for the journey. We analyze the self-
reported aspiration to migrate, as these are more infor-
mative measures than migration behavior in contexts
of high immobility (i.e., Covid-19, visa restrictions;
Carling & Schewel, 2018). In all waves, we measured
aspiration by asking how much respondents would
like to migrate within the next year, regardless of
whether they are able to (5-point scale). We analyze
the effects of the program in two ways: through a
difference-in-means approach in outcome waves 2
and 3 and a difference-in-difference approach com-
paring baseline aspirations to migrate with outcome
waves 2 and 3. All models include regional/training
site fixed effects and inverse-probability weights
(IPWs).¹⁰ The difference-in-means models are shown
in Equation (1):

$Y_{i}=\alpha+\beta~Treat_{i}+\phi+\epsilon_{i}$,

(1)

where $Y_{i}$ denotes the aspiration to migrate in each
wave, $Treat_{i}$ refers to the program treatment assign-
ment, $\phi$ is regional fixed effects (our blocking variable),
and $\epsilon_{i}$ is the error term.

The difference-in-difference models follow Equa-
tion (2):

$Y_{i}=\alpha+\beta~Treat_{i}+\gamma~Post_{i}+\delta(Treat_{i}Post_{i})+\phi+\epsilon_{i}$,

(2)

¹⁰ Online Appendix D shows that the treatment did not affect individuals'
choice to migrate regionally or outside of Africa.
¹¹ The inclusion of fixed effects is unlikely to bias our estimates because
treatment assignment does not differ significantly across regions $(p=.826)$.

where $Y_{i}$ is the dependent variable, $\beta$ is the treatment
group-specific effect, $\gamma$ is the effect of time, com-
mon to control and treatment groups. $\delta$ shows the
effect of the treatment between two waves. Similar
to Equation (1), $\phi$ represents our regional blocking
variable and $\epsilon_{i}$ is the error term. We estimate two mod-
els to reflect the differences between waves 2 and 3,
respectively, against the baseline.

We report the results of the program on the aspi-
ration to migrate in **Table 2**. After z-standardizing
the outcome, we see that the treatment reduced the
aspiration to migrate by more than a quarter of a stan-
dard deviation 1 month after the program ended (in
Wave 2), but the coefficient dropped to around a tenth
of a standard deviation in Wave 3 (Online Appendix
B). Models (1) and (3) are difference-in-means mod-
els for waves 2 and 3, respectively. Models (2) and
(4) are difference-in-difference models showing short-
term (difference between baseline and wave 2) and
long-term (difference between baseline and wave 3)
differences.

$\div p<.10$ $p<.05$, ** $*p<.01$

Beginning with the short-term effects of the pro-
gram reported in Models (1) and (2), we see aspirations
among the treatment group are lower than the con-
trol group. The difference-in-means reported in Model
(1) shows that the mean-level aspiration among the
control group was approximately 3.7, but the mean
of the treatment group was reduced by .31. The
difference-in-difference approach reflects virtually the
same effects.

However, when we turn to the longer term effects
of the program in Models (3) and (4), we see that the
treatment effects are no longer statistically significant
at the .05 level. Attrition in wave 3 reduced the preci-
sion of our estimates. However, when comparing wave
3 to wave 2, we also see a slight convergence in migra-
tion aspirations across treatment and control group
respondents. This change is not statistically significant
so it is difficult to draw conclusions. ¹¹

Migration outcomes can take many years to exe-
cute and were significantly impacted by the Covid-19
pandemic that coincided with our fieldwork. However,
we have tentative evidence that program effects went
beyond aspirations. In Online Appendix F, we find that
treated respondents in both waves were less likely to
pursue active plans to move abroad.

Online Appendix Q includes a detailed discussion of
how Covid-19 may have impacted our results. Control
group participants' migration planning grew steadily
across waves, indicating that Covid-19 is likely to have
negatively affected instrumental place attachment
over the period of the survey. Treated respondents,

¹¹ Online Appendix C considers a range of potential moderators, including
demographic variables, business experience, and access to migrant networks.
We find little evidence of the conditionality of the program's effects over-
all. However, we find that aspirations to migrate increased among treated
individuals who already owned businesses when they applied to the program,
compared to those who applied without existing businesses in wave 3.

endowed with cash and skills by wave 2, may have felt
less vulnerable to the Covid-driven economic shock
than control group respondents; planning among the
treatment group decreased significantly by wave 2,
before increasing in wave 3. Desire to migrate among
the control group follows a similar pattern. We also
find that greater Covid-19 uncertainty at an individ-
ual level is associated with lower instrumental place
attachment.

# MEDIATION ANALYSIS

Having shown that the program had some direct
effects on migration aspirations, we will proceed
by using multiple mediation analysis to identify
the mechanisms by which those effects take root
and eventually fade. We hypothesized three possible
psychological mechanisms. In this section, we will
describe how we operationalize each of these media-
tors, show how the program influenced each directly,
and then use multiple mediation analysis to better
understand the indirect effects of the intervention.

This paper proposes a new mediator-instrumental
place attachment. Our item asks respondents to com-
pare places (The Gambia and their preferred migration
destination) in terms of how well they can accom-
modate the pursuit of livelihood goals. Specifically,
we asked respondents to consider whether it would
be easier to achieve their financial goals in The
Gambia or in their preferred migration destination.
This item is intended to capture the instrumental com-

ponent of place attachment as defined by Jorgensen
and Stedman (2001), Kyle et al. (2004), and others. That
is, it captures how well a setting serves goal attain-
ment given other alternatives. ¹² Respondents were
prompted to think about how circumstances might be
"one year from now" so that we can draw inferences
beyond the immediate circumstances of the Covid-19
pandemic.

The program explicitly intended to promote eco-
nomic self-sufficiency. The cash grant, paired with a
practical training program-which would allow par-
ticipants to channel this investment into a money-
generating enterprise-was expected to enable finan-
cial independence and, thereby, decrease aspirations
to migrate. We measure economic self-sufficiency
through a battery that asks respondents about their
expected ability to meet their economic needs in
1 year. Because education is one of the main drivers
of perceived self-efficacy, or the belief in one's capa-
bilities to pursue a domain-specific goal, we expected
participation in the skills and cash-grant program to
affect this mediator as well. We include another bat-
tery to operationalize entrepreneurial self-efficacy. See
Online Appendix P for question wording.

Before beginning our multiple mediation analysis, it
is important to consider the correlation between our
three mediators. This can help us establish whether
our three concepts are not only theoretically distinct,

¹² We asked respondents their preferred migration destination earlier in the
survey. For respondents who did not identify a valid destination country, the
item piped in the word, "abroad."

but are also distinct in practice. In Online
Appendix G, we find a strikingly weak correlation
between instrumental place attachment and our other
two mediators ($r=.10$ and $r=.05$ for self-sufficiency
and self-efficacy, respectively). Self-efficacy and self-
sufficiency are moderately correlated ($r=.30$). Of our
three mechanisms, instrumental place attachment
is the one more closely related to our dependent
variable, migration aspirations, because it explicitly
elicits a comparison across countries. ¹³ However, it
is also the most difficult item for the project to move.
While self-efficacy and self-sufficiency should follow
directly from a project of this kind, instrumental place
attachment requires the project to compete against
stark global inequalities that it cannot change.

**Figure 2** reports the results of the treatment on
each mediator. These results reflect between-subjects
tests and are estimated through ordinary least squares
(OLS) models including regional fixed effects and
inverse-probability weights. The black point esti-
mates represent the difference-in-means between the
treatment and control groups at wave 2, and the
white point estimates refer to wave 3. All dependent
variables the psychological mediators-are mea-
sured on 5-point scales, allowing us to make direct
comparisons between the effects.

As we can see in Figure 2, the program achieved its
anticipated effects on program participants, particu-
larly in wave 2. Roughly 1 month after the coaching
ended, program participants felt significantly more
confident than the nonparticipating counterparts that
they would be economically self-sufficient within the
year. That perceived self-sufficiency persisted well into
the third wave of data collection 6 months later. The
magnitude of the effects decreased over time, but only
very slightly, with a treatment effect of .33 in wave 2
and .25 in wave 3. The results were very similar for
self-efficacy, but the change over time was somewhat
greater. Relative to nonparticipants, program partic-
ipants exhibited .32 points higher in self-efficacy
wave 2 and a difference of.15 in wave 3.

in

The change over time was most stark in terms of
instrumental place attachment. In the short term, pro-
gram participants felt that it was significantly easier
to achieve financial success in The Gambia, relative
to their nonparticipating counterparts. The difference
between the two groups was comparable in magni-
tude to other wave 2 mediators at .31. However, the
difference between participants and nonparticipants
decreased dramatically to .8 by wave 3, and the effect
is was no longer statistically significant. ¹⁴

Therefore, we can confidently conclude that the pro-
gram decreased the aspiration to migrate, at least in
the short term, and we have also demonstrated that
the program had its desired effects on self-sufficiency,
self-efficacy, and instrumental place attachment (in
the short term). We can now estimate the average
causal mediation effect (ACME), or the indirect effects
of the treatment to the outcome through the spec-
ified mediating mechanisms. This will enable us to
quantify the extent to which each psychological medi-
ator channels the effect of the program to migration
attitudes.

To identify the independent effects of each medi-
ator, we use multiple mediation analysis to control
for alternative mediators using the multimed func-
tion of R's mediation package (Tingley et al., 2014).
We also control for age, education, gender, whether
the respondent owned a business at baseline, whether
the respondent had owned a business in the past,
and the IOM's application score for the respondent,
to satisfy the sequential ignorability assumption in the
second step of the mediation equation (Imai et al.,
2011).

**Figure 3** shows the ACMEs for each wave 2 media-
tor as they channel the effect to migration aspirations
in wave 2 (short term, in black) and wave 3 (long
term in white). We use wave 2 mediators for both
short- and long-term estimates because they capture

¹³ This comparative element may have elicited a different way of thinking (see
McKenzie, 2022, on the psychological underpinnings of place attachment),
and may have led to the weak correlation we observe between instrumental
place attachment and our other mediators.
¹⁴ As we mention in our theory section, there are many sources of instrumental
place attachment. We control for all of these in Online Appendix M and our
results remain substantively similar.

Based on **Figure 3**, we can draw some conclu-
sions about the mediating mechanisms from the
program to migration aspirations. Despite the strong
short-term and long-term effects of the program
on self-sufficiency and self-efficacy, neither of these
mediators has a significant indirect effect on migration
aspirations. For the most part, the point estimates are
very near to zero and are not statistically significant.
There is a near exception with the long-term effects of
self-efficacy. The ACME for this mechanism is -.05, but
it is not statistically significant.

The only mediator to significantly channel the
effects of the program is Financial Success at Home,
our instrumental place-attachment mechanism. That
is, individuals softened their desire to migrate when
they believed it easier to achieve financial success in

The Gambia than abroad. This effect is significant for
both short-term and long-term migration aspirations,
though the magnitude of the indirect effect decreases
from .08 to .05.

In short, our analysis reveals that even if RCA
programs are effective in its direct aims-improving
self-sufficiency and self-efficacy-only instrumental
place attachment reduces aspirations to migrate. ¹⁵
These results are meaningful for various reasons. First,
RCA programs are expected to shift migration aspira-
tions through economic self-sufficiency. Our analyses
do not find evidence for this effect. Second, as we men-
tion earlier, instrumental place attachment requires
believing that livelihood goals are more attainable in
one's place of residence than a migration destination.
That a small RCA project shifted aspirations through
this channel is striking in the face of global wealth
inequalities. We explore this finding further in the next

section.

# INTERVIEWS WITH DEVELOPMENT
PRACTITIONERS AND YOUNG
ENTREPRENEURS

Questions remain regarding how the program was
able to influence instrumental place attachment and
why this influence was short-lived. We interviewed
four IO and NGO practitioners involved in the design
or implementation of the IOM's program and 10
young Gambian entrepreneurs who currently have
businesses and did not participate in the IOM training
program.

Among the place-bound constraints facing young
entrepreneurs in The Gambia, all interviewees-
practitioners and entrepreneurs-highlighted a lack
of "developed" credit systems and a confusing and
obscure bureaucratic and regulatory environment. For
example, according to an independent consultant who
led the design of the program (FP2),¹⁶ registering a
new business and paying taxes is very difficult in The
Gambia. It is not obvious which authorities are respon-
sible for taxes, and each authority might provide a
widely different estimate on how much tax needs to be
paid. This complex bureaucratic environment limits
the potential impact of a skills-development program.
"You can have the skills... you can learn about busi-
ness," said FP1. "But in the end you are working in a
certain environment where there are different outside
obstacles."

These obstacles bar access to productive assets. For
example, The Gambia-based Lead Program Manager

¹⁵ In line with our results on economic self-sufficiency, Online Appendix
H shows that business success in wave 3 does not significantly mediate
aspiration to migrate.

or entrepreneur, and interview order. FP1 is Female-Practictioner-1

SIMON ET AL...

of the project (MP1) explained that a confusing regula-
tory environment bars entrepreneurs from registering
their business, which, in turn, would allow them
to access credit. All practitioners and entrepreneurs
suggested that development organizations are in a
position to step in and facilitate this access. Accord-
ing to MP1, "Even though [entrepreneurs] know they
have the skills, even though they feel they're empow-
ered, it's really still very difficult to navigate the [policy]
environment without the assistance of an institute like
IOM... or the coaches, or the mentors."¹⁷

All practitioners highlighted the same two dimen-
sions as necessary for development interventions to
succeed in doing this: helping participants navigate
government regulations, or navigating them on their
behalf and continued social support through local
networks of mentors and like-minded entrepreneurs
who graduated from the program. The Gambia project
intervened on these two dimensions and may have,
thereby, increased participants' perception that their
financial goals were easier to achieve at home than
anywhere else. First, the project organizers liaised
directly with the government to facilitate participants'
access to credit. "We linked up with the necessary gov-
ernment offices to [issue] identity cards," said MP1.
This would "then enable them to get tax identification
number [...] to open a bank account. For the registra-
tion itself, we liaised with the Ministry of Justice, and
we fast-tracked the registration itself." The project also
embedded this practical know-how into the training
program. Second, the intervention actively facilitated
the formation of Gambian support networks with
mentors and other participants, and organized a trade
fair to allow for networking opportunities. "They cre-
ated bonds... they had a group of people that were
supporting them. It's very important that you feel that
someone is not letting you fall..." said FP2, herself an
entrepreneur. However, she recognizes the temporal
limitations of this support. "I don't know how much
they stayed in the networks," she acknowledged. ¹⁸

Exploratory survey analyses (Online Appendix L)
support practitioners' expectations that instrumental
place attachment is fostered by local support net-
works and the ability to navigate the local bureaucratic

¹⁷ It is worth noting that MP1, FP2, and FP4's interviews can help us distin-
guish instrumental place attachment from the related concept-or drivers
of self-efficacy. They suggest that "empowerment" is not enough; the ability
to access resources within their place of residence is necessary for them to
succeed.

¹⁸ Networks might also counter instrumental place attachment. Migrant net-
works facilitate migration by passing on information about host policies and
integration (e.g., Blair et al., 2021). Instrumental place attachment requires
comparing home and potential destination countries. If individuals receive
information from networks on how to access productive assets abroad or if
the network can provide social capital, this may lend greater weight to the
destination country in their comparative evaluation.

environment. Moreover, we find that participating in
the RCA project significantly impacted feelings of sup-
port across the two waves, though effects decreased
over time. A drop in local support networks-as FP2
suspected-may explain the reduction in instrumen-
tal place attachment experienced in wave 3, and the
program's limited long-term effects on migration aspi-
rations (**Figure 3**). Participating in the YEP did not
significantly improve entrepreneurs' perceived abil-
ity to understand local government regulations. FP2
came to believe that projects that actually change
bureaucratic environments as in, "work with the
governments to change the law" rather than simply
facilitating access-can have longer term impacts on
instrumental place attachment.

Practitioners focused on how programming can be
improved by countering bureaucratic obstacles and
building networks, but there are also more essential
ways a YEP may increase instrumental place attach-
ment. Entrepreneurs may come to believe it is easier to
pursue their goals in The Gambia because the content
of the YEP is place-specific and not immediately trans-
ferable (MP3). In a typical YEP, NGO or IO practitioners
will help an aspiring entrepreneur generate a busi-
ness plan, which makes reference to legal, economic,
and other aspects of the place. This involves identify-
ing a unique market for goods or services, and what
makes these goods and services unique there; identify-
ing the materials the entrepreneur will need and where
to acquire them in the place; identifying a locale, and
considering any risks, costs, and benefits associated
with that choice-that is, crime rate, location in rela-
tion to target market, quality of public services (Pinson
& Jinnet, 1993). The local knowledge that generates-
or is obtained through this process-may be asso-
ciated with the belief that economic goals can be
better achieved locally than anywhere else. Moreover,
entrepreneurs' livelihood goals or plans are, them-
selves, shaped by what the place offers and permits;
the goals adapt to the place.

By facilitating the process of matching goals to
place, development actors may be promoting instru-
mental place attachment. In doing so, they may
provide an opportunity-albeit imperfect and often
ineffective to "make it in The Gambia." Indeed, all
young entrepreneurs interviewed valued the training
and grants that IOs and NGOs could provide, if they
could get a place on a program. However, they all
noted how inadequate YEPs tend to be. Grants are
small, if obtained, and oftentimes only provide them
with materials rather than cash. As FE4 suggests, "in
Gambia you can start your own business without going
anywhere but... if you don't have access to [the right
startup capital and materials] and the problem in The
Gambia is too much..." she pauses. "[Migration] will
not solve the problem. But if you are sitting here

without doing anything, the only thing that come to
your mind is to migrate."

# DISCUSSION

In this paper, we sought to examine the mechanisms
through which "Root Causes Aid" may shape migra-
tion aspirations. RCA is a non-compulsory form of
immigration control, which seeks to make or improve
the option to stay through economic development. We
conduct an experimental impact evaluation of a YEP
implemented by the IOM in The Gambia. These pro-
grams are representative of RCA sent for economic
development in sub-Saharan Africa (Conrad Suso,
2019).

We find that the project helped participants start
or grow businesses, reduced migration aspirations,
and slowed preparations for the journey. However,
the aspiration to migrate was attenuated only in the
short term. We find that the primary acting mech-
anism through which aid shifts migration attitudes
is instrumental place attachment-or the perceived
ability to pursue important livelihood goals in one's
place of residence compared to a potential migra-
tion destination. A development project may increase
instrumental place attachment if it helps participants
navigate place-specific obstacles to obtain access pro-
ductive assets in their place of residence-for instance,
access to credit or equipment. As such, we exam-
ine why instrumental place attachment rose and fell
in tandem with aspirations through interviews with
experts involved in the design and implementation
of the project, interviews with entrepreneurs, and
additional quantitative analyses.

We contribute to the literature on the effectiveness
of development projects in stemming migration. By
examining changes in migration aspirations prior to
departure, we are better able to isolate the effects of
economic development interventions in the presence
of external migration control agreements, which often
go hand in hand with RCA. Survey data also allowed
us to examine the psychological effects of aid, allowing
us to contribute to a mixed evidence base from a dif-
ferent angle. However, several questions remain about
how these findings translate into behavioral migration
outcomes other than preparation for the journey. One
possibility-which we were unable to implement due
to long-term Covid-19 mobility restrictions-would be
to follow up some months later and ask respondents
whether they have migrated. Although our endline
results showed null effects, it is possible that migra-
tion aspirations among the encashed treatment group
would have risen.

Our study is based on one origin country and one
intervention. Furthermore, while the backdrop of the
pandemic makes for a theoretically interesting con-

CAN FOREIGN AID REDUCE THE DESIRE TO EMIGRATE?

text, it is also a unique period of history that may
reduce the generalizability of our findings. Indeed, it
is not necessarily the case that the results of this RCT
will easily generalize to other YEPs, let alone other
RCA projects in other contexts. Moreover, it is unclear
whether and how the program would have worked in
a country with lower levels of migratory aspirations.
On one hand, high aspirations create a benchmark
that should be easier to lower if the project is effec-
tive; on the other, high aspirations create obstacles
that can render the project ineffective (Conrad Suso,
2019). We also encourage scholars to consider how the
magnitude, frequency, and timing of aid flows affect
place attachment, and the importance of the actor
delivering or disbursing the aid.

Given limitations on the generalizability of our
results, our quantitative and qualitative analyses focus
on mechanisms. Specifically, we developed theoretical
expectations on the drivers of migration aspirations
and tied them to a general framework used by major
aid agencies (UNDP, 2017). Through interviews, we
aimed to identify project features that may elicit these
mechanisms. This allows us to consider the poten-
tial for instrumental place attachment in other RCA
projects such as, for example, building community
sanitation works or providing technical assistance to
local bureaucrats. These types of projects focus on
place even more than the project we evaluated, which
was primarily a labor "supply-side" intervention (Fox
& Kaul, 2018). ¹⁹ However, instrumental place attach-
ment is also driven by the ability to pursue a specific
goal in a place, and this project focused on hon-
ing entrepreneurs' place-bound skills, knowledge, and
plans in relation to that specific goal. As our expert
interviewees suggest, an intervention that focuses on
individual and place in equal parts may elicit instru-
mental place attachment more successfully and in the
longer term.
